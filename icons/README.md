# Icon Placeholder

The extension currently uses SVG placeholders for icons. To create proper PNG icons:

## Option 1: Use an online tool
1. Visit https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or similar
2. Upload a logo or create one
3. Generate 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files
4. Save them as icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png in this folder

## Option 2: Create manually
Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.) to create:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Design Guidelines
- Use the gradient colors: #6366f1 to #8b5cf6
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Suggested symbols: brain, memory chip, database, or code brackets
- Dark background (#1e293b) works well with the extension theme

## Temporary Workaround
For now, you can use the SVG file or create simple colored squares as placeholders.
The extension will work without proper icons, they just won't look as polished.
